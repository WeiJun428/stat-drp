k-word / tuple

k = 1 

Duplex DNA
- fr(A) = fr(T), fr(C) = fr(G), fr(A + T) = 1 - fr(C + G)
- GC 3 hydrogen bond and AT means 2 bond.

Leading strand - replicated from 5' to 3' direction (5th carbon to 3rd carbon)
- GC skew where G > C
- determine location of replication origin and termini in prokaryotic

Probability Distribution for Discrete Random Variable
- X is probability, L is the sequence itself

Independece
- Mulitplication rules for probability

Independent and identically distributed (iid)
- Random variables that are independent and having the same distribution 

Expected Value and Variances: a lot of formula

Binomial distribution

Simulation using pseudorandom numbers. Partition 0 to 1 into each possible values

k = 2
- describe the trajectory of DNA bending, which affects the gene expression

Markov Chain
- k-order markov chain if it depends on the previous k entry.
- row: t th entry, column: (t + 1) th entry
- transition/markov matrix and initial probability distribution PI

-stationary distribution if PI = PI * P

k = 3: codons
- Gene class 1 expressed at moderate level where class 2 expressed at high level.
- class 1 fits reasonably well to naive independent model but class 2 differs a lot

Codon Adaptation Index
- Product of 
	codon used to code for the amino acids in highly expressed genes /
	the most frequently used codon of the corresponding amino acid in highly expressed genes
