Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Used in speech recognition
	20 amino acids - 256 categories, protein family - words, insertion & deletion - time variation

CpG Island - Deregulation of Island.
- CG -> TG by methylation, rare
- Methylation is suppressed in short stretches of genome, (e.g. promoter/start region), where more CG

Markov Chain
- Modelling beginning and end state as silent.
- Adding end state models the length of sequence where length decays exponentially

Markov Chain in Discrimination
- Likelihood Ratio Test: assess the goodness of fit of two competing models
- Get two markov, CpG island or not
- Ask question about (3.3) formula confusing t'

HMM
- Enable variable length and sharp boundary
- Two state: (+) and (-), with similar P but - a small P to switch state where (+) to (-) is greater so that overall more -

Formal definition
- state sequence = path = PI
- Emission probability = P(xi | PI): Probability of b in state PI

Casino
- State of sequence is hidden
- Can use HMM to generate/emit artifical sequences

Viterbi Algorithm
- Decode: Determine the underlying state
- Use summation of log to simulate product of small P
- Use DP to find the most probable path

For example,
From P(From C- to G+) = 0.1
means Emission Probability P(prev_state = - and curr_state = +) * P(base = G given that curr_state = +) given that previous base = C
